## running it locally

run a local file server from the root of the repo.

I like using [deno's file server](/learn/deno-file-server/), but you can use any.

If you have node, you can run `npx serve -p 6543`, then open <http://localhost:6543>

If you have python, you can run `python3 -m http.server 6543`, then open <http://localhost:6543>
